## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

### When POS Searches "John":
```
Request  → Cloud Function receives: "John"
          ↓
Function → Searches Firestore customers collection
          ↓
Function → Finds: John Doe, Johnny Smith, John Wilson
          ↓
Function → Filters out emails, addresses, notes
          ↓
Response → Returns only: [{id, name, phone}, {id, name, phone}]
          ↓
POS      → Displays search results (name + phone only)
```

### Audit Log Entry:
```
2025-10-20 15:30:45 - User abc123 searched "John" - 3 results
```
