2. Add a product to cart
3. Complete a test sale
4. Note the invoice ID

#### Test Admin Review
1. Go to `http://localhost:9002/pending-transactions`
2. You should see your test transaction
3. Click on it to view details
4. Click **"Finalize"** to approve it

#### Verify Finalization
1. Go to `http://localhost:9002/final-invoices`

┌─────────────┐
│ POS Employee│ Makes a sale
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼

│ pending_transactions │ ← Employee writes here (cannot read)
└──────┬───────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Admin Reviews│ Daily review in dashboard
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────────┐

}
```

### final_invoices
